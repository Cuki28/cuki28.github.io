I believe that creativity is the starting point to find the solution to most of the problems and situations we face every day. I am very thoughtful and intuitive for every project I get involved in. I like to internalize myself as thoroughly as possible, to find the perfect sound that represents each music and thus be able to reflect the essence of each one of them. For this reason, I am in constant training to continue incorporating new tools that allow me to solve in the most efficient and creative way.
